# GuessAndCheckers
GuessAndCheckers is a mobile application that works as an helper for users that play the
Italian checkers game "live" (i.e., by means of physical board and pieces). It features a fully-
declarative approach to such a complex problem, making use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) as
an effective formalism for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). The application relies
on the EmbASP framework for embedding ASP in complex systems, resulting in one of the first real use cases of the framework, and on OpenCV, an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. The app, that runs on Android, is able to suggest a user the move depending on
the state of the board acquired by means of the mobile device camera.
